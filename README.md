# Technical Assessment

This is my technical assessment for the Front-end Developer role at Juniper Education. I have chosen to host it on GitHub for ease of access to the code and to provide a live version of the website through GitHub Pages. The files and code have been purposely structured to keep each part of the technical assessment grouped together for ease of review; this is not how I would usually organise the files and code of a website.

## Part 1

For Part 1, I chose to recreate the **Tower House in Numbers (statistics area)** from the Adobe XD design provided.

- The section was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a strong focus on responsiveness, accessibility, and animation.
- I decided to use **Font Awesome** for the icons in line with common workplace practice. Since I do not have Font Awesome Pro, I used substitute icons as placeholders.
- For the swipeable components, I chose to use **SwiperJS**, again in line with common workplace practice.

## Part 2

With Part 1 using mostly **HTML** and **CSS**, I decided to focus primarily on **JavaScript** for Part 2 by creating an interactive **Math Quiz**.

- The quiz dynamically generates random maths questions.
- It creates two plausible but incorrect answers alongside the correct answer, then shuffles all options randomly to avoid predictability.
- The quiz tracks the userâ€™s current streak and best streak, storing the best streak using localStorage so it persists between sessions.
- I have also added comments throughout the **JavaScript** explaining what the code is doing.
